Implementation of Discrete Kalman Fiter in Matlab/Octave with a simple example

This is the implementation of Kalman Fiter in Matlab/Octave according to the paper entitled "An Introduction to the Kalman Filter" by Greg Welch and Gary Bishop. The paper is available at https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/media/pdf/kalman_intro.pdf .This example is based on the voltage reading error expressed in the above mentioned paper. The resultant graph could be a little bit different from the provided one in the paper because of the random generator used in this specific implementation.
